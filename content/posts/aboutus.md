Before I start.. Why do you see English in most of the places in a Tamil Blog site? That's just need of the time where we have to keep certain portions of our site in English until search engine users become well versed with Tamil based search. 

Lets focus on what you should know about us - We are set of Tamil enthusiasts working together to serve Tamil content in the best way possible. Our articles are kept simple and made to the point what is intended to convey. Our primary focus is to take Tamil language to the maximum possible audience via technology.

We also offer services to students, authors, business organizations to review their creations and thoughts and to make it publish ready. Our parent company -  www.tamilbot.com has been very supportive in building the blogging community in all aspects.
